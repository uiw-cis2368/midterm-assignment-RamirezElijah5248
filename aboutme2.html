      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello everyon, My name is Elijah Ramirez and this is my first attempt at creatinf a website. 
        Since this is my first time I thought I should use this opportunity to share a little about my self.
        Bellow are some of the things that I have done that sum up who I am.   </p>
      <h2>College</h2>
      <p>I started my college career back in 2018 after graduating from Central Catholic High School.
        I have switched my majors a couple of time however I can finally say that I have found a major I 
        am in love with and can see myself doing for the rest of my life. 
      </p>
      <hr><br>
      <h2>National Guardsman</h2>
      <p>I Joined the National Guard back in September of 2019 and was shipped off to basic training on 
        January 28, 2020. I joined mostly for the educations benefits but also for the adventure that is the Army.
        Though the Army and I don't Always see eye to eye I would do it again in a heart beat. I learned a lot 
        from the military and I'm sure I'll learn a lot more in the years to come. </p>
      <hr><br>
      <h2>Musician</h2>
      <p>My music career is a very short one but none the less something I find to be a hallmark of who I am. 
        I joined band in highschool with zero musical experience and I lef tbeing able to play the tenor saxophone,
        the snare drum, and a little piano.</p>
      
        <hr><br>
      <h2>Martial Artist</h2>
      <p>My journey with martial arts is a long one. I have been doing martial arts for around 18 years starting way
         back when I was four years old. I started my martial arts journey at the Dojo Karate Academy and trained 
         there for about 14 years where i eventually recieved my 1st Dan BlackBelt. When I turned 18 I shifted my 
         focus to boxing and have been training on and off since 2018. In the future i would like to take up judo and
         juijitsu but I'll have to wait for the money to come in before that can happen. 

      </p>
